1. Fix drawing for rod. Add noise for reeling in. Add animation for bubble/splash
3. Include Fishing as part of unlockables in shop at certain lvl + money cost dont forget import assets in player!

4. Implement better shop, (maybe price changes, like a real market?).

Better shop, use arrows to indicate increase in price etc (bar graphs no)
Decrease in price if too much expenditure
