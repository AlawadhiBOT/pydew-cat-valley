3. Implement better shop, (maybe price changes, like a real market?).
4. Include Fishing as part of unlockables in shop at certain lvl + money cost dont forget import assets in player!

Better shop, use arrows to indicate increase in price etc (bar graphs no)
Decrease in price if too much expenditure

For fishing, make animations.
Add Lucy to game

Apples, seeds exist (need to add seeds to inventory

for fishing music, turn on when player starts fishing
